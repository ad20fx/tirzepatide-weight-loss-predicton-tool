## **Overview** ##
This project is a single-page, client-side web app that:
1. Collects basic patient inputs (weight, height, age, sex, diabetes status).
2. Lets the user select a tirzepatide dose (5/10/15 mg).
3. Computes a predicted 72‑week weight-loss trajectory.
4. Displays results as:
  (i) A table of predicted weight, BMI, and weight-loss % at key timepoints.
  (ii) A Chart.js line chart with two y-axes and IQR (interquartile range) shaded bands.
It is intended for educational/research visualization and explicitly includes a disclaimer.
